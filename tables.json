Montgomery’s army stopped the German advance toward Alexandria and Cairo, ensuring the safety of Egypt. The battle signaled the beginning of the end of Germany’s campaign in North Africa, guaranteeing the Allies control of the Suez Canal and the Middle East’s oil fields and significantly shifting the momentum of the war in favor of the Allies.",
